## Homebrew recipes for CloudBioLinux

This repository contains [Homebrew][1]/[Linuxbrew][2] recipes for
[CloudBioLinux][3]. Maintenance for the programs here has moved to
the [bioconda project](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes).
Feel free to use any recipes here. If anyone wants to take ownership of a
particular recipe, moving them to [homebrew-science][4] ensures you can support
them for long term stability.
